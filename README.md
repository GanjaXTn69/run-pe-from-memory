# run-pe-from-memory
this c++ project will be mapping a pe file into memory and run it, supports only x64 for now.

it also suports passing app arguments and you'll be able to print the executed pe output.

i took inspiration from  [Codecrack3k](https://github.com/codecrack3)'s [Run-Portable-Executable-From-Memory](https://github.com/codecrack3/Run-PE---Run-Portable-Executable-From-Memory) that runs only x86 PE
